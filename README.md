# Treasury Direct Password Autocomplete Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension that will rewrite the [Treasury Direct login page](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/) to add autocomplete attributes to the password fields. This will allow your browser to fill in the username and password that it has stored for you, instead of having to type it in with the virtual keyboard.

### Installation

2. In Chrome or Edge, go to `chrome://extensions/`.
